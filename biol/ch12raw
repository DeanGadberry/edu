// CH12 notes raw

you see all these, that are all vesicles. they are coming ina nd literally dumping what they need to build te cell wall. the vesicles, who brought it in are going to  fuse and become the cell wall on that side.

binary means two
fision means separate
so binary fission is 

of course prokaryotes are basically just clones of each other

here's the kicker. in porkaryotes, they have a single circular chromosome. Unlike animals, which have a chromosome 

prokaryotes have an origin of replication, which is the location in which the replication always begins. 

when prokaryotes do the replication, they can do so bidirectionally. 

so the mechanism is the sames. They have two leading and two lagging.

prokaryotes existed before eukaryotes. So mitosis probably evolved from binary fission. there are protists who exist which are right in between mitosis and binary fision

mitochondria and chloroplast have circular DNA. They do their own replication.

mitochondria follow our control and our regulation.

the fruquency of cell division is dependent upon the type of cell. they all have the same cycle, but different timing
