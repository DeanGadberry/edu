The double-helical model of DNA is already known. It was dicovered in 1953 by Francis Crick. 

so in this case what we have is we have a homozygous and you know a hetergozygous. Then we have the paternal has the normal and the maternal has the mutant Igf2. The mother has the normal Igf2 and the father has the mutant gene, then the mouse will be a dwarf mouse; the mutant is expressed through the paternal gene.

viruses can infect any living thing. There is a virus that infects the mesophyle cells in the tobacco plant which means that the virus is very specific. Viruses at large are rampant in all living things.
When bacteriophages infect bacteria, they cannot get inside of the cell wall. So they use their legs to walk to the bacteria, and make a hole on the cell wall. The bacteriophage (or phage) delivers genetic information to the bacteria. That genetic information will procreate themselves. 
They start by destroying the DNA of the bacteria. Then they take over the machinery of the prokaryote and replicate the same translation and transcription machines to reproduce theirselves. 

3 alternative DNA replication models
    1. Conservative Model 
        parental strands reassociate (they clone)
    2. Semiconservative Model
        parental strands separate (like cut in half and sew half to each)
    3. Dispersive Model
        parental strands are mixed throughout daughter strands (like a zebra)
