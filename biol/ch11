G-protein coupled receptors
    bind energy-rich GTP. They are all very similar in structure
Receptor Tyrosine Kinase
    sets of tyrosines come together to form a dimer. They also receive 6 phosphates from ATP. Then the RTK can bind to relay proteins.
Ligand-gated ion channels
    opens when ligand binds, allowing ions to pass through
Intracellular receptors
    small or hydrophobic messengers which can travel through the cell membrane

Protein phosphorylation and Dephosphorylation

    Signalling molecule activates relay molecule. 
    protein kinase is activated. 
    ***Kinase phosphorylates***
    this activates another protein kinase etc etc
    Then an inactive protein is activated through phosphorylation. 
        (signalling takes multiple steps == cascade mechanism)
Protein kinases transfer phosphates from ATP to protein, a process called phosphorylation
Phophatases are enzymes which remove the phosphate.

Cyclic AMP (cAMP) (adenosine monophosphate)
    amplifier which acts as secondary messenger
Adenylyl cylase 
    enzyme which converts ATP to cAMP
    this is one of the enzymes which a G-protein may bind to. 
Calcium
    a widely used secondary messenger

Scaffolding Protein
    large relay protein which has other relay proteins attached
