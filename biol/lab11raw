the first t rna thatt's gonna come is going to be the start. once it's hooked up, the large suunit is going to bind. 
Here's met, not the A is where the new tRNA with the new amino acid comes in. 
once that it's in there, then what's gonna happen is that the newxt amino acid is going to bind there
In the P site, the peptide bond is going to happen. Then the amino acid is no longer hooked to the tRNA, and the tRNA disconnects at the E site.

molecular engineering is all about taking a genome and cutting the genome and isolatif a specific gne sequence. We use a specific set of proteins called restriction endonucleases. 
    endo means inside
    nuclease nmeans nucleotide
    restriction means cut
    these enzymes cut the gene sequences

creating genes for specific proteins 
we can synthsize antisense nucleic acid molecules.
