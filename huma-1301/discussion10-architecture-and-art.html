    This antebellum home in Charlotte South Carolina exemplifies the use of Roman Architecture in the United States. This home features a colonnaded patio, sitting atop a triumphal arch passageway. The columns are a simple rendition of the roman composite style, which is very tasteful in light of the simplicity of the comprehensive design. 
    While the architrave is lightly ornate, the frieze is flat to match the pediment. The geisons show an attention to detail with their well carved rounds.
    Why do I find this pleasing? Well, just look at it. The craftsmanship is impeccable. The only reason I know I am not in rome when I walk upon this beautiful building is because I can see the bricks on the side. the architects who designed the antebellum homes deserve awards, yet they are likely lost to history.

    Beautiful work on the Geisons.

    I've included this image to show how the roman influence is making a resurgence, even today. This home in San Antonio is listed for some millions of dollars. It has all of the typical clashings of "modern" homes today. They can not decide whether they would like a spanish exterior, a brutalist kitchen, or a beachside resort patio. Thankfully they did include one crucial piece. This groin vault above the dining table. 
    Groin vaults are ingenious works which allowed for some magnificent structures to be created before the dome. The ability to include this in a modern home is redemptive and appreciated by an architectural aficionado.
