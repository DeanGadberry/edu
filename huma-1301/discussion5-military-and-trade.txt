Ancient people used military development and trade to control and manipulate each other. The Roman Emprie used its military power to conquer new territories and expand its influence while also using trade to establish economic dominance over the newly conquered people. The Han Dynasty of China used its military power to secure the Silk Road trade route which allowed them to establish economic superiority. This interrelationship allowed ancient people to exploit societies and oppress people.
Today, countries use military power and trade in similar ways. The United States, Russia, and China have such large militaries that they are considered global superpowers. This power, along with economic power makes establishing trade deals easier for the powerful parties. 
Trade is full of cultural exchanges. Cultural trade is the dispersment of cultural practices, traditions and ideas between societies. This is the premise of international trade. "You honor me, and I will honor you." Without cultural understanding and exchange, this honor cannot be commmunicated. Sometimes, cultural trade is used to promote the dominant culture of a strong society. This form of cultural trade is often oppressive and exclusive.
