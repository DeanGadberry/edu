Well, this week was very interesting. My mother is a nurse, and growing up, my siblings and I were exposed to a lot of medical terminology and ideas. I am surprised by the idea of "The Four Humors". It is very unlike the way that we diagnose issues today, in that it is too simple. I remember learning that the brain used to be thought of as hydraulic, that all of the sensations from limb to brain were fluid. This made sense in a time when fluid dynamics were the highest technology. Today, we know about electricity, and we ascribe electric signals to our nervous system, and computation to our brain. There is a reminiscent theme in these teachings of medicine from long ago. Today, I wonder how simple our understanding is. 

The Ascelpian tradition was based on divine and supernatural forces controlling the natural world. The Hippocratic method diverged from these themes. Hippocrates found observation and empirical evidence was a better drive of rational thought. Medical history is much more important in the Hippocratic method, and the approach taken to diagnosis and treatment is more comprehensive. 

Our modern medical system is similar to the Hippocratic method in the efforts of both systems to prevent disease before it occurs. The healthy lifestyle may even be attributed to our old friend, Hippocrates.
