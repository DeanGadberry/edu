Compare and contrast the view of women in the various societies discussed this week.  How were women able to impact society even in those civilizations that placed great restrictions upon them?  Are there still gender distinctions in the modern world?  If so, what are they?  If not, how were we able to eliminate them?

In Rome, women had more rights and freedoms than those in Athens. In both societies they were able to impact society. In Rome, women would get involved in philanthropic activities, and around the world, women assumed the role of mothers and wives. Some Egyptian women held important religious roles. 

Gender distinctions have changed in the last 200 years. In the United States, men generally worked outside the home in agriculture or a trade. Women usually focused on domestic labor and bearing children. Religious and cultural values perpetuated the idea that women were inferior to men and should be submissive to them.

Now, women have opportunities for education and employment. They can vote, participate in the workfore and they are recognized for their achievements. The gender wage gap has yet to shrink and women are not portrayed equaly in entertainment.

Evolutionary adaptations are tough to fight. Men are physically stronger than women and better fit for manual labor. Women are greater nurturers and raise children better than men. These facts don't change, and we shouldn't try to change them, but people deserve to be seen for who they are and what they achieve.
