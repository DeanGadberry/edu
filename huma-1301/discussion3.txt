Hindu
    Temple
    Dwelling place for the gods
    deity resides at heart of temple
    other deities and other mythical figures are incorporated into the structure
    not designed for large congregations
        people come and go through a small hall-way to an inner sanctuary
            this is where the main deity is
    large tower resembling mythical mountain of the gods
    Some sexual scenes

Buddhist
    Stupa
    Hemispherical Mound
        Represents burial mound of Buddha where his relics were deposited
        gateways marking the cardinal directions
            worshippers enter through a gate and walk clockwise
            elaborately carved
        fertility deities absorbed into pantheon
            Appeal to popular taste
            voluptuous women carved into pillars and gateways
    Sometimes small Ash-carrying containers
    East Asian Stupas are more narrow
    Can be the object of worship - standing in for the Buddha in imagery
