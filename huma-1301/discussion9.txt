Out of the philosophical traditions of Daoism, Confucianism, and Legalism, I feel most connected to Confucianism. I appreciate the values of lifelong learning and sowing into the future-self, and I agree that knowledge promotes good in life. I feel a sense of duty, in my life, as a soon-to-be husband, and an aspiring father. Confucianism embodies a perspective of honor and social responsibility which rivals the Christian traditions which raised me. 
I feel most uncomfortable with the Legalistic approach to government and consequences. The word, "Legalism", generally leaves a bad taste in my mouth. "Legalistic" is a derogatory term used, in Christian churches in America, to mean "Judgmental". I am also uncomfortable with the rejection of organized religion posited by Daoism and Legalism. I understand that Daoism emphasizes a rejection of material things. In my life, that is very difficult to deal with. I frequently enjoy shopping to find peace and entertainment to feel happy. I understand that these are unhealthy habits, but there are real, and Daoism makes me confront that discomfort.
