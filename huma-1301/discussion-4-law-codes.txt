Pretend that you are Hammurabi.  A visiting Chinese diplomat has just seen your code and has criticized its inequality based on class and gender and its harsh punishments.  How would you defend the code to this foreign dignitary?

I am Hammurabi, and you have insulted my government. You criticize my code based on class and gender and "harsh punishments". You do not understand the value of the code. 

The written law was given to me by the sun god, Shamash. I have written it down to secure our values. The individual may be more restricted, but this is the only way to achieve a just society. (Fiero, 26)

You say that my code is unjust regarding class. How can you make such a claim, while you have killed the slaves which build the tombs of your kings. (Fiero, 68) You and I both know that a man who can make wealth is more valuable than a retched man. 

Also, you claim that the code is unjust to women. Women are less strong in their mind and body. Their value is in housekeeping and bearing children. (Fiero, 27) The law gives them legal protection and commercial freedom, a great success in our society.
