    At the end of my speech, the audience will know some ways to listen actively.

    The article may be paraphrased with the following sentences, "Active Listening is important for many marriages. Active Listening skills are necessary in business. All the best people say that active listening is an essential life skill." The article proceeds to share advice for actively listening and then shares ways to avoid not active listening.

    This article interested me because I am fervently seeking the ability to be a good listener. As a husband and a father, I need every resource which is available to succeed in leading my family. 

    The specific purpose of the article is to share a few practical tips for listening, and to explain which habits may hinder active listening. The article also explains a few reasons why active listening is important for interpersonal communication. 

    Individuals from every culture, ethnicity, and gender can benefit from the skill of active listening. After my speech, it will be obvious that anyone can benefit from active listening.
