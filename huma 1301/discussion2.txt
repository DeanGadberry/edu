Using Ninian Smart's "Seven Dimensions of Religion", what are the characteristics of religion?  
Why do you think humans developed religions?  
How does what we believe shape how we act towards others and toward other belief systems? 
What were some of the similarities in the early religions?    

Smart characterizes religions well, referring to the narratives which create community around an object of worship and adoration. Religions dictated the way people constructed social and legal structures, and also the structures which housed their manifold beliefs. 
Humans developed religion to make sense of those things which are otherwise beyond normal understanding. With the assistance of trance, prayers, and psychedelics, prophets, shamans, and priests developed complex mythology to assist in explaining the unseen things. 
Communities focused on religious truths would be at odds with each other because of their differing beliefs. Whether a religious system promotes love or hate towards unbelievers would affect the ways that different religious individuals would act toward each other. The religious believe that they are right, and pity those who lack understanding.
The early religions were similar, in that they often had a creation myth, some of which are nearly identical. The early religions showed how history preceding their time had brought upon the blessings or plight of the ancients.
