While reading Mask's chapter, focused on Haiti's Cholera outbreaks, I recognized the similarities that Cholera has to COVID-19. Initially, I noticed that COVID-19 and Cholera both originated from South Asia. Seeking depth, I noticed a pattern: both the COVID-19 pandemic and Haiti's Cholera outbreak resulted in widespread community aid projects, and intense disease mapping efforts. 

Misinformation is not without its place in these similar tales. The devastating effects of these public health crises continue to change our world, and it is valuable to seek to understand the original events that poised the community for such havoc. When I read that findings, which revealed that the cholera outbreak originated from the UN base, werenâ€™t published, I am driven to ask whether there are similar pressures on the news outlets of our day which are not able to share facts about the origin of COVID-19. 

I found it interesting, in this chapter, to learn about the mapping efforts that epidemiologists have been developing through the ages. While the WHO focuses on treating people's ailments, the epidemiologists of the world are busy learning about the causes and possible preventative measures regarding various diseases. I ruminate on how difficult it must be to try to map these diseases in transient and unmapped places. 

I am reminded, via this chapter, that I am fortunate to have the clean water and commonly accessible amenities available to me. Location is pivotal, providing an opportunity to be healthy, but even offering a method for mapping diseases.

I noticed that these videos mentioned the intense efforts to educate the populace of Haiti regarding cholera. What type of efforts do you think this included?
